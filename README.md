# Persona-HTML
An ongoing project to make a Persona game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for learning purposes.

Browser compatibility is primarily with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

In order to properly play the game in Chrome, change Google Chrome's autoplay policy behaviour. This ensures compatibility with Chrome.

Announcement: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes

Steps:
1) On Google Chrome, type the following into the address bar:  chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy
2) Next to "Autoplay Policy", change the value from "Default", to "No user gesture is required".
